Hello, neighbor! I'm so glad you're here. This little program was made with care, just for people like you. It believes that everyone is special, and that even small, simple things can make the world a better place.

What's this all about?
This is mr-rogers. It helps brighten your day with a loving quote from the man himself. Just like Mr. Rogers, it tries to be a friendly and helpful presence on your computer. It does its job quietly, simply, and without any fuss.

## Putting On Your Sneakers (Installation)
Getting started is as easy as changing into your favorite sweater. You just need to follow these simple steps.

    # Clone the repository to your local machine
    git clone https://github.com/P1NK0/mr-rogers.git

    # Move into the neighborhood
    cd mr-rogers

    # Invite Mr. Rogers
    go build mr-rogers

And just like that, you're ready to go!

On macOS and Linux, it will be named mr-rogers.

On Windows, it will be named mr-rogers.exe.

## Making It Easy to Find
It's always nice when things are easy to find. We'll put our new program on a special shelf where the computer always knows to look.

On macOS and Linux üêß
From inside the mr-rogers folder, we'll move our program to a shared spot. We need to use sudo, which is like using a grown-up's key for an important door. The computer will likely ask for your password to make sure it's you.

    sudo mv mr-rogers /usr/local/bin/
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mr-rogers
    
On Windows ü™ü
First, let's create a special folder inside your personal user directory. This is a safe and tidy place for programs. We'll call it bin.

    mkdir ~\.bin

Next, move your new program into that folder.

    move mr-rogers.exe ~\.bin

Finally, we need to tell Windows to always look on our new "shelf." This is called adding it to your Path.

    Press the Windows Key and type "environment variables".

    Click on "Edit the system environment variables."

    Click the "Environment Variables..." button.

    In the top box ("User variables for..."), select the variable named Path, then click "Edit...". (If it doesn't exist, click "New..." and name the variable Path).

    Click "New" and type in the path to our new folder: %USERPROFILE%\.bin

    Click "OK" on all the windows to save your changes.

## Enjoy a Moment of Kindness
Now that you've installed it, you just need to open a new terminal and type the program's name.

    mr-rogers

You did it. You've made a special place for kindness on your computer. I'm proud of you.
